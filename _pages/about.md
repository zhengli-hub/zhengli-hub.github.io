<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi there ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Zane, a Ph.D. student and graduate research assistant in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, advised by [Prof. Xiaopeng Li](https://engineering.wisc.edu/directory/profile/xiaopeng-li/). My research focuses on intelligent transportation systems, with particular emphasis on autonomous vehicles, traffic flow theory, and the application of large language models.

Before joining UWâ€“Madison, I earned my masterâ€™s degree in transportation engineering from Tongji University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm) and [Prof. Ye Tian](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1185.htm).

I aim to understand and model the complex interactions between human drivers, automated driving systems, and traffic control devices. My recent work examines how autonomous vehicle behavior patterns affect traffic dynamics and infrastructure performance, drawing on microscopic simulation, trajectory data analysis, and optimization techniques.

Iâ€™m also passionate about bridging transportation engineering and computer science, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Sciences alongside my Ph.D.

Feel free to explore my work, reach out for collaborations, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zheng-li-540608298/) / [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ZCy63TMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra). You can also email me at [zli2674@wisc.edu](zli2674@wisc.edu).
